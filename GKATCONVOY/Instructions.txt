Un-PBO the file, edit config.sqf for any settings and convoys you want

RePBO and add into your @ExileServer/Addons

=================================

Where this convoy script stands out is, this one will limit convoy types, if you have any number of convoy types setup, and turn on the limiter, this will only allow each convoy to spawn once.

Also the marker system is different, most convoy scripts I've seen mark the actual vehicles or start and end positions. This one puts a "last known location" marker, meaning there's a bit of ambiguity of the marker and vehicle location. All completely configurable.

Lastly, foot soldiers. Had to experiment a good speed to reliably keep them alive. A few still get run over sometimes but that's just Arma.
